This course includes and covers all of my study notes so that you can use them in addition to your own notes.

1. [Get Started with AI](./1-get-started-with-ai.md)
1. [Visual Tools for ML](./2-visual-tools-for-ml.md)
1. [Computer Vision](./3-computer-vision.md)

## ðŸ’¡ How can I pass the AI 900 Certification?

Start by creating your own study strategy. This repository has _my own notes_ but you should create yours as part of studying for the course. I show you how I did it below ðŸ‘‡

**[Centralized details](https://learn.microsoft.com/certifications/azure-ai-fundamentals/?WT.mc_id=academic-0000-alfredodeza)**

* Download the skills outline

* Go through the 5 Learning Paths:

1. [Get Started with AI](https://learn.microsoft.com/training/paths/get-started-with-artificial-intelligence-on-azure/?WT.mc_id=academic-0000-alfredodeza)
1. [Explore Visual Tools for ML](https://learn.microsoft.com/training/paths/create-no-code-predictive-models-azure-machine-learning/?WT.mc_id=academic-0000-alfredodeza)
1. [Explore Computer Vision](https://learn.microsoft.com/training/paths/explore-computer-vision-microsoft-azure/?WT.mc_id=academic-0000-alfredodeza)
1. [Explore Natural Language Processing](https://learn.microsoft.com/training/paths/explore-natural-language-processing/?WT.mc_id=academic-0000-alfredodeza)
1. [Explore Decision Support](https://learn.microsoft.com/training/paths/explore-fundamentals-of-decision-support/?WT.mc_id=academic-0000-alfredodeza)

Next, go through each Learning Path and create a markdown file for each that includes every learn module.

* Summarize

Sample repo structure:

```
.
â”œâ”€â”€ 1-get-started-with-ai.md
â”œâ”€â”€ 2-visual-tools-for-ml.md
â”œâ”€â”€ 3-computer-vision.md
â”œâ”€â”€ 4-natural-language-processing.md
â”œâ”€â”€ 5-decission-support.md
â””â”€â”€ README.md
```

1. Create a repository and add the markdown files, one for each section
1. Start summarizing, adding the Learning Path and Learning Module for each section
1. Capture services, definitions, and any key differentiators

Sample section:

```
## Main topic

### Service Name

Definition: Some definition

Features:

* Feature 1
* Feature 2
```

Find key differences for similar services. For example, IoT Hub vs. IoT Central:

**IoT Hub:** More control, less managed (no dashboard). Telemetry analysis.

**IoT Central:** Less control, more managed (dashboard included). Telemetry analysis.
