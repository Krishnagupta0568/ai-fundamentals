# Get Started with Machine Learning

# Machine Learning

Definition: Machine learning has its origins in statistics and mathematical modeling of data. The fundamental idea of machine learning is to use data from past observations to predict unknown outcomes or values.

# Machine Learning as a Function

Machine learning models are mathematical functions that calculate an output based on input features. 
The process involves two key stages:

- Training: predicts based on past observations.
- Inferencing Phase: Use the trained model to make predictions on new data.

# Types of Machine Learning

- **Supervised Machine Learning**
  
  Definition: training data contains both features and labels. The model learns the relationship between these to predict unknown labels for new data.

- Types of Supervised Machine Learning

  - **Regression**: Predicts a numeric value.
  - **Classification**: Predicts a category (class).

    **Two types of Classification**
      - **Binary Classification**: Two possible outcomes (e.g., True/False).
      - **Multiclass Classification**: Multiple exclusive outcomes. Example: Dog Breed - German Shepeard, Golden Retreiver, Pitbull etc.
  
- **Unsupervised Machine Learning**

  Definition: the data contains only features with no labels. The goal is to uncover patterns or relationships in the data.

 - **Clustering**: Groups similar data points into clusters based on feature similarity. Examples: Group flowers by petal and leaf attributes.

**Note**
 - **Difference from Classification**: Clustering doesn’t use predefined labels; it identifies groupings based on the data itself.


## Summary

| Table | Type |	Input	Output |	Example |
| -     | -    |   -           | -        |       
| Supervised Learning	| Features + Labels	| Predictions for new data	| Predict ice cream sales or penguin species. | 
| Unsupervised Learning	| Features only	| Patterns or groups in data	| Segment customers or group flowers. | 
| Regression	| Features + Numeric Labels	| Numeric predictions	| Predict house prices or car mileage. | 
| Binary Classification	| Features + Binary Labels	| True/False predictions	| Predict loan default or diabetes risk. | 
| Multiclass Classification	| Features + Multiclass Labels	| Single class prediction	| Predict movie genres or penguin species. | 
| Clustering	| Features only	| Similarity-based groupings	| Group customers or products. | 

**KeyNote** : Choose the ML type based on your data and prediction goals—supervised for known labels and unsupervised for discovering hidden patterns.
